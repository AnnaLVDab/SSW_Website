    <h1>üë®‚Äçüç≥ Preparation</h1>
    <p>Cooking ramen the traditional way is both an art and a science, requiring attention to detail and a passion for flavor.</p>
    <p>Here are the key steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
           <strong>Broth Preparation:</strong> The heart of any ramen dish is its broth, which can be based on chicken, pork, beef, or seafood. 
            The broth is simmered for hours, sometimes even days, to extract deep, rich flavors. Common types include shoyu (soy sauce), 
            miso, shio (salt), and tonkotsu (pork bone).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Noodle Making:</strong> Traditional ramen noodles are made from wheat flour, water, salt, and kansui (a type of alkaline mineral water).
             Kansui gives the noodles their distinct chewiness and yellow hue. The dough is kneaded, rested, and rolled before being cut 
             into thin strands.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Toppings Preparation:</strong> Toppings vary widely but often include chashu (braised pork belly), marinated soft-boiled eggs, nori,
             menma, and green onions. Each topping is prepared with care to enhance the overall dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assembly:</strong> The cooked noodles are placed in a bowl, followed by the hot broth and toppings. Each component is arranged thoughtfully 
            to create a visually appealing and balanced dish.
        </li>
    </ol>
